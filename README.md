# Can someone make this look nice. 

ALPHA VERSION. DO NOT USE. LOGGING IS STILL off.

New ArnePilot based off master which means if everythings goes to as we planned we should be uptodated all the time.

only has:
  -always on lkas for toyota and honda.
  -dev ui some of the bits and stuff are from hkg. @chanhojung, @crwusiz and @cydia2020
  -dashcam is there just uncomment it for now in ui.cc
  -dark setting. git pull and flash panda button under network setting.
  -no more nagging to upgrade to prime. instead look at my pretty prius:)
  -rsa can be enabled if you want but you gotta turn it on means add it to lateral( dont ask).
  -op_edit is there so check for feature and PLEASE INPUT YOUR DAMN username.
  -no logging what so ever.
  -dynamic gas is there can only control it from op_edit
